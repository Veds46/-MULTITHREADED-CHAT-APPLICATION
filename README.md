Task 3 of the Java internship involves developing a real-time client-server chat application using Java sockets and multithreading. This application will allow multiple users to communicate with each other through a central server that manages message exchange. The chat system consists of two primary components: the server and the client. The server will be responsible for listening to incoming client connections and ensuring smooth message delivery. It will continuously accept new client connections, assigning each connection to a separate thread to handle communication efficiently. The client application, on the other hand, will connect to the server using Java sockets, enabling users to send and receive messages in real-time. Messages sent by one user should be broadcasted to all connected users, creating an interactive chatroom experience.
To achieve this, the server will maintain a list of active clients, allowing it to distribute messages effectively. The client program will have an interface, either text-based or graphical, that allows users to enter messages and view responses. The implementation of multithreading is crucial to ensure that multiple users can interact without any delays. Javaâ€™s Thread class or ExecutorService can be used to manage multiple clients simultaneously, preventing any single user from blocking the communication process. Additionally, the application can be enhanced by adding features like private messaging between users, a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing or JavaFX, and encryption for secure communication. Logging chat history to a file could also be implemented for record-keeping purposes.
The final deliverable for this task will be a fully functional chat application that includes a server capable of handling multiple clients, a client program for user interaction, and proper documentation explaining its setup and functionality. This project will provide valuable hands-on experience in network programming, multithreading, and socket communication in Java, which are essential skills for building real-time applications. By working on this task, one will gain a deeper understanding of how concurrent connections work and how to manage client-server interactions efficiently.
